## About the Course

This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Part II focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms.

## The assignments

- [_Percolation_][1] - Write a program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation.
- [_Queues_][2] - Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue.
- [_Collinear_][3] - Write a program to recognize line patterns in a given set of points.
- [_8puzzle_][4] - Write a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A* search algorithm.
